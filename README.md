## Monitoring App

Introducing the Monitoring App: Because Trusting Apps Blindly is So 2010.

- Tired of those sneaky apps snooping around your device, peeking into your files like nosy neighbors? Well, fear no more! We proudly present the Monitoring App, your very own digital watchdog with a sense of humor (and impeccable security skills). It's like having a personal bouncer for your files, notifying you whenever an app tries to access them. With this app by your side, you'll have the power to say, "Mind your own business!" So go ahead, join the league of mighty file protectors, I am open to any contributers.
